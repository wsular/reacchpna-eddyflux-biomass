Observations using SIMILE widgets:

* timestamps are superduper finicky
    * ISO8601 is not preferred, but accepted
    * OK to replace the 'T' with a space but timezone must follow time 
        with NO space (2015-08-13 09:00:00-0800)
    * javascript Date() _does_ require 'T' to parse correctly

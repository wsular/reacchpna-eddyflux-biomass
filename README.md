Objective 2 - Biomass Sampling
==============================

Regional Approaches to Climate Change (2011-2016)
-------------------------------------------------

Biomass sampling data and records to supplement greenhouse gas flux tower
measurements.

### What's Here

| Directory   | Contents |
|-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/analysis` | one-off files focused on a particular analytical topics      |
| `/BADM`     | "Biological, Ancillary, Disturbance and Metadata" files per Ameriflux standard |
| `/data`     | several spreadsheets with measurements data (see below)      |
| `/records`  | useful metadata files                                        |

#### The `/data` folder

Each Excel&reg; workbook contains a in this folder aggregates a particular data source into a homogeneous tabluar format with a standard nomeclature. Data are reviewed upon entry and, when necessary, adjusted or even discarded, to satisfy quality constraints. 

There is also a subfolder, `/Truspec`, containing original results as-received from laboratory technicians who operated the carbon/nitrogen analyzer (LECO).


### Nomeclature


| sample_type | |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| whole       | entire above-ground crop biomass |
| product     | separated crop product           |
| residue     | above-ground biomass, separated from crop product |
